Introduction:

The aim of this code was to build a small quiz that timed the user and allowed them to answer multiple choice questions. The user is meant to complete the quiz in as little time possible. Too many wrong answers will result in the quiz being aborted. It also logs a high score JSON structure to the local storage and allows the user to keep track of their own scores. A high score table is automaticvally built from getting the local storage JSON structure.
